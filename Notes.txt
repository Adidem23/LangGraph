Autonomy is the most promising feature of the ai agentic system but we have to control autonomy of an ai agentic system

- Premission Scope
- Human in the Loop
- override controls 
- Guardrails / Policies

AI agents always make multiple plans and agents make more than one plan and choose one depending upon some parameters like efficiency , cost , risk , alignment and tool_availability

AI agents has multiple characteristics:
- Autonomy
- Goal Orientiated 
- Planning 
- Reasoning
- Adapatibility
- Context Awareness

AI agents has multiple level Components : 
- Brain 
- Tools 
- Orchestrator
- Memory
- Supervisor
